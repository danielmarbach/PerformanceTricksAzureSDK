# How to use with Logitec Spotlight

Add a bookmark to your browser with the following content

```javascript
javascript:   Reveal.configure({   keyboard: {     39: 'next',     37: 'prev'   } });
```

This remaps the right arrow to next and the left arrow to the previous slide.

Execute the bookmark before the presentation when you use the spotlight presenter. Make sure the cursor is on the fullscreen browser on the extended screen
