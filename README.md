# Performance tricks I learned from contributing to the Azure .NET SDK

As a practical learner, I've found that performance optimizations have been my biggest challenge and the place I've learned the tricks that are the most helpful. These lessons have come by trial and error. As it turns out, the Azure .NET SDK was a perfect “playground” for learning new tricks because it's maintained by people who care and give feedback. 

Over the past few years, I've contributed over fifty pull requests to the Azure .NET SDK and some of them got accepted. In this session, I'll walk you through the performance improvements I learned from my experiments. Some “superpowers” you will learn are spotting closure allocations and opportunities for memory pooling and, best of all, how to improve them. 

## Outline

.NET has been evolving over the years into a modern and high performance platform. The languages running on .NET have also been improving and allowing to fall down to lower levels without giving up on the safety guarantees too much or only where it is really needed. It is less and less needed to use unmanaged languages likek C/C++ to achieve code that performs well at scale.

## Caveats

In this talk I'm going to focus on some performance optimizations that can be done in code that is library and framework like. I won't be talking about architectural patterns like vertical or horizontal scaling. The focus is purely on code with examples in CSharp. Some of the optimizations shown here can be seen as esoteric in typical line of business applications and I wouldn't recommend jumping to conclusions and applying those everywhere. Yet it is important to note that for code that is executed under scale optimizations on code can bring a lot of benefit to the table due to not only being fast but also being more efficient in resource usage, execution time, throughput and memory usage.

But what does at scale even mean? How can I find out whether the optimizations I'm trying to make have value and I'm not getting called out by my colleagues for premature optimizations?

## What does at scale mean?

I've heard it countless times already: "Wow that's crazy, is the complexity of this change really worth it? Isn't that premature optimization?" While it is true that performance improvements can be addictive, it is also true that nobody likes to optimize code that is "fast enough" or is only executed a few times day on a background job.
